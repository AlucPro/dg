I used to discuss a book with a friend, probably on the topic of domestication.

It probably means that in the process of human development, pigs, cattle, and sheep were successfully domesticated and became domestic animals.

But the author said: It was these domestic animals that successfully domesticated humans. Because humans have to build houses for them, feed them regularly, and help them reproduce!

One day, I suddenly thought that we are also animals domesticated by work.
