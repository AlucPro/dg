What's my case:

* Many devices (Camera、Android、Iphone)

* Many big-size photos, e.g.：after a hiking，I may produce 30+G photos (If include videos, it can be bigger)

What I want:

* easy to finish

* I can access my photos anywhere

Pipeline:

* Devices (Iphone、Camera、Android) -> Cloud Drive (Like Adrive)

* Cloud Drive -> Pixel -> Google Photos
