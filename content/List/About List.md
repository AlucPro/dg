Recently I read a book called [Lists of Notes](https://book.douban.com/subject/30365536/) from a friend.

It contains a list of 124 notes that talks about a lot of things.

I loved this book because it was a first-hand account.

On the one hand, they provide a lot of valuable advice.
On the other hand, I can imagine what the author was going through through reading, which is interesting.

Inspired by this, I decided to write down some interesting lists in this notebook.

### Basic
- ðŸ“– [[List of Book]]
- ðŸŽ¬ [[List of Movie]]
